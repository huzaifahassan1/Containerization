# Containerization
This repository is a place to share and experiment with Docker projects.
What is Containerization?<br>

**Packaging Made Easy**: Containerization is like putting your application and all its needs (code, files, settings) into a box. This box (the container) has everything the app needs to run.<br>
**Run Anywhere**: That box can run on any computer with a container system (like Docker) installed. No more "it works on my machine!" problems.<br>
**Lightweight and Fast**: Containers are much smaller than full virtual machines and start up quickly, making them great for development and deployment.<br>
**Why Does Containerization Matter?**<br>

**Consistency**: Your app works the same everywhere, from your laptop to a giant server in the cloud.<br>
**Efficiency**: Run multiple apps on the same machine without them interfering with each other.<br>
**Portability**: Easily move apps between environments, making development and deployment smoother.<br>
**Cloud-Readiness**: Perfect for modern cloud-based development processes.<br>

**Docker**: Install Docker on your system. You can find instructions on the official Docker website: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/<br>
**Basic Docker Knowledge**: It's good to know commands like docker build, docker run, and docker ps.<br>
